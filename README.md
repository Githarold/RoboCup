# RoboCup Repository

This repository is dedicated to recording the participation code for RoboCup. It includes the algorithm and setup instructions needed to get started.

## How to Run the Algorithm

Follow these steps to run the algorithm:

### Step 1: Set Up ROS IP
1. Open the `init.m` file.
2. Change the `rosIP` variable on the second line to the ROS IP of your virtual machine.

### Step 2: Run the Algorithm
- The algorithm is implemented using Stateflow and m-files.
- Simply run the `init.m` file to execute the algorithm.
